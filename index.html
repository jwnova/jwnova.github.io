					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">The theme of my footage is “flow”. Flow means rhythm and loop, and it also gives life to things. My video materials were shot in Dublin, Galway, a dart station, and two national parks, and I  found that trying to restore the emotion of the moment that I was shooting them is very meaningful as well.</p>

					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">I gained inspiration from Michelangelo Antonioni’s L'Eclisse and Douglas Gordon’s 24 hour Psycho. I found the multi-angle of the former is helpful to represent the space I was in, so I try to imitate it, especially in the third footage called the dart station.</p>

					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">I also interested in the low frame rate of the latter, I think it is useful to build emotion, and highlight the contrast of movement and stationary, but I found that strengthening the image tail has the same effect, and it is good for viewing experience.</p>

					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">I think the essence of flow is time, so I want present time’s flow by recording both of emotion and environment. To be specific, it is mainly reflected in the crowd and cars in cities, so I recorded plenty videos of footage and cars. In the first footage called Dublin, I focused on the contrast of lonely person and the crowd. In the second footage called Galway, I focused on the contrast of the elder and the kids. For dart station and national parks, I placed more emphasis on recording environment changes.</p>

					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">Paddy Jolley and Ori Gersht inspired my shooting approach. As my work progressed, I found 
						there was no subject in my footage, and the expression of voiceover and B-rolls was poor, so 
						I turned to seek for a more abstract way, instead, I recorded some dialogues of a movie called 
						The Magdalene Sisters, which tells a true story happened in the last century.</p>

					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">Contrast and montage were the emphases in the first part of the video, the change of scenes 
						follows the progress of the dialogue, father and nun’s voices are peaceful and numb, it shows
						a sad atmosphere when I slow down 60 fps videos. The dialogues had ground noise even I 
						used DeNoise to decrease it, so I added a piece of cello music. Animals are the image of the 
						poor girls and kids, they are sinner, but sinner for nothing. In the second part, I put a religious 
						song as the background to compare with the broken ruins to reveal that faith should give 
						happiness rather than tragedy upon believers.</p>

					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">For sound + X's MG animation color scheme, I took into account the fact that the short film was based on a product introduction, and that the product was a music-themed social platform, so it was appropriate to use high-contrast, high-energy colors with minimal color richness. Therefore, the choice of gray, pink and other colors with strong contrast, combined with the movement of the graphics, can well show the publicity effect of the short film.</p>

					<p class="except mt-3 mb-3 text-center">In this project, the image elements of MG animation are flat, the dynamic effects and transitions are clear and concise. So how to convey rich effects through simple visual elements? The answer is sound effects. The transformation between scenes, the change of color elements, the change between subjects, the change between sounds and so on, should be combined with animation. The specific work sequence is to match sound effects with the time track of the picture and edit the music into the rhythm of the picture after the completion of MG animation. In addition, background music with full of energy and clear rhythm changes can better attract the audience's attention in this kind of short animation.</p>

Inspired by the author's hometown city, this short film presents the evolution process of a series of iconic buildings and presents the complex construction process in the form of origami. A huge city is only a small part of the world, but even a small part also contains infinite vitality.</p>
